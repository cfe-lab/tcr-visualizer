*__Note: Archived, this repo is for reference only. See [`bblab-server`](https://github.com/cfe-lab/bblab-server) for current implementation__*

This tool takes as input the A, B, and AB distance files as output by the [`tcr-distance`] tool and generates a network diagram visualization of them.

This tool can be accessed [`here`] at the BBLab-Wiki.
